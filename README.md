WSDL2ZKSforce
=============

Code generator for ZKSforce

This is a scala script that generates code for inclusion with ZKSforce from the partner.WSDL, this helps (me) not to have to write lots of boiler plate code, and to more easily support new additions to the Salesforce Partner API.

You do NOT need to use this if you want to use ZKSforce, just grab ZKSforce and go, this is just used to update it to newer API versions as they are released.
